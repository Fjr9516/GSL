# GSL
Guided Subspace Learning
============GSL demo===================
In the file, there are multiple .m files.
>>
GSL.m : Core codes of GSL algorithm.

NGSL.m : Core codes of NGSL algorithm.

demoGSL.m : Evaluate GSL/NGSL on an example task (C-W in 4DA dataset).
>>

You can run the "demoGSL.m" code for your reference.  Then you will get the results:
>>
GSL: Choose 'primal' as 'kernel_type', the final accrucy will be ‘55.93%’.

NGSL: Choose 'linear'(linear kernel in our paper,for example) as 'kernel_type' , the final accrucy will be ‘63.39%’.
>>

Once you run the code, please correctly set the path of the data and liblinear toolbox
